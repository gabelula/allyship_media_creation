Journalism is a powerful tool. A place to show different views of the world as well and an opportunity to do active solidarity and.  Based on the Ada Initiative Ally Skills workshop by Valerie Aurora, this lab puts ally skills to work on journalistic product. How can we take our professional skills as journalists, editors, data scientists, programmers et al , and really commit to changing the way we cover issues and produce product?

Keeping our desire to fight inequality at the fore how would those skills change the reporting on the contentious issues of right now and confront systemic oppression with journalistic excellence.
