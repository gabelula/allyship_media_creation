## Terminology

If you’re unsure what terms to use in order to avoid being offensive, just ask!


Privilege: an unearned advantage given to some people but not all

Oppression: systemic, pervasive inequality present throughout society that benefits people with more privilege and harms those with fewer privileges

Target: someone who suffers from oppression

Ally: a member of a social group that enjoys some privilege that is working to end oppression and understand their own privilege

Cis: your gender is the same as the gender that was assigned to you at birth

Trans: your gender is different than the gender that was assigned to you at birth

Non-binary or genderqueer: "male" or "female" doesn't describe your gender accurately

Groups of people by gender: men for cis and trans men, women for cis and trans women, non-binary people/folks, cis men, trans men, cis women, trans women, people of all genders, folks, people, everyone, all...

Straight: women attracted primarily to men or men attracted primarily to women

Gay: men or women attracted primarily to people of the same gender as themselves

Lesbian: women attracted primarily to women

Bisexual: people attracted to both men and women

Pansexual: people attracted to people of any gender

Asexual: people with little or no sexual attraction to people of any gender

Queer : useful catch-all term for people who don't fit easily into "straight cis woman" or "straight cis man"
Use the term(s) for each ethnic group or race that the majority of that group prefers that outsiders use

Avoid abbreviations for ethnic groups - just say or write the full name

Use "abled person," "disabled," or "person with disabilities"

Terms not to use in this workshop

"Political correctness" - invented and promoted by bigoted U.S. conservatives

"Girls" for women 18 years of age and over

"Females" for humans - used for animals and plants too

"Guys" for groups that are not all men

"Ladies" - associated with "proper" (i.e., subservient) behavior

"Transsexual" - not inclusive of all trans people

"People with [BODY PART or CHROMOSOME]" instead of "men" or "women"
Coded words or phrases like "ethnic" or "from the banlieues" to mean people of a particular race or ethnic group
Don’t use "lame," "dumb," "retard," "stupid," "crazy," etc.; instead use "foolish," "thoughtless," or "inconsiderate" or a specific adjective like "crowded," "disorganized," or "annoying"
It’s fine to use figures of speech like "see what I mean" or "I hear you"

## Workshop discussion guidelines

You may leave or return at any time, for any reason, without explanation

Please don’t repeat sensitive things, or anonymize them if you do

Focus on what an ally can do in this situation, not the target

Avoid rules-lawyering - there are no trick questions

Speak respectfully about religious or spiritual beliefs (but you don't need to be respectful of bigotry or intolerance)

Don’t use stereotypes about people with lower class jobs (e.g. janitor), adults of particular ages, family role (mother, grandparent, etc.)

Treat caregivers of all sorts respectfully, including mothers

## Guidelines for responding to oppression

* Be short, simple, and firm
* Humor usually backfires, avoid it
* Pick your battles
* Play for the audience
* Practice simple responses

Don't be sexist, homophobic, transphobic, racist, ableist, classist or make fun of people for being sexually undesirable, unattractive, etc.

## Guidelines for future ally work

* Don't expect praise and credit for fighting inequality
* Follow and support leaders from target groups
* Assume targets are knowledgeable about their oppression
* Follow your discomfort: if something makes you feel bad, find out more and understand why before reacting
* When you make a mistake, apologize, correct yourself, and move on
